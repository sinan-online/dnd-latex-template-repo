# D&amp;D LaTeX Template

A template repo to create D&amp;D documents using LaTeX.

# Quick Start

1. Clone the repo (Need Git knowledge for this, and Git installed. Git Desktop should do fine if you are starting.)
2. Open in VS Code, "open in container" when prompted. If in container, you can use a VS Code task to compile.
3. You do not have to use VS Code. If you are on GitHub, when you "git push", it will compile and create a PDF file on the repo.
